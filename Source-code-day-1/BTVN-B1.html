        <p>Designers design buildings. Engineers engineer them. But the law 
            <br/> is New York’s foundational architect and building block.</p>
        <p>Before plans can be drawn up and construction crews can start jackhammering, legislators, lawyers, public
            representatives and planners decide how streets and buildings will be configured, the different ways they
            can be used and occupied, not to mention when and by whom.</p>
        <p>The half mile or so between <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;"> 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/arts/design/broadway-architecture-virus.html"> Times Square</a> </span>
            and Grand Central Terminal along 42nd Street, the heart of Midtown
            Manhattan, is ordinarily stoked by commerce and commuters. Its daily life, architecture and economy have
            taken shape over the years in no small measure as a consequence of legislative and political maneuvers,
            legal squabbles, regulations and court decisions.</p>
        <p>This is the latest in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/arts/design/carnegie-hall-lincoln-center-virtual-tour.html">a series </a> </span>

            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/27/arts/design/jackson-heights-queens-virtual-walk-tour.html">walks around the city </a> </span>
            . Jerold S. Kayden teaches law and
            urban planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he holds a chair named after the lawyer who
            greatly influenced the drafting of New York’s (and America’s) first comprehensive zoning legislation. Mr.
            Kayden clerked for Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and is an expert on the city’s so-called
            Privately Owned Public Spaces. He doesn’t seem to mind being referred to as the Pops of POPS.</p>
        <p>He mapped a legal-minded itinerary along 42nd Street from Times Square to the East River, taking in the
            United Nations, Tudor City and Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo’s recently,

            , all architectural must-sees. For the sake of brevity, we decided beforehand to skip other obvious landmarks
            like the Chrysler Building, the New York Public Library and the Daily News Building. In the event, we
            covered a semester’s worth of land-use law by the time we reached Grand Central, which seemed enough for one
            walk, so we won’t get to any of those East Side favorites in this conversation.</p>
